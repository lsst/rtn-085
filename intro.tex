\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

We pull together information from Jira and refer to other documents as needed to describe DP1 in more detail.

DP1 should be released to the community after the First Look image is released to the press.


\subsection{DP1 Scope}
DP1 comprises data from ComCam on sky.
There will be PVIs.
There is no promise of coadds but if there is good data this is a stretch goal.

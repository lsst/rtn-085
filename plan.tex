\subsection{Component plans}
\subsubsection{Middleware}
We need client server butler \jira{PREOPS-3697}

Any Workflow needs ?

\subsection{RSP}
The RSP is updated weekly.

DP0 features for querying, subsetting, and analysis will be available for DP1.
Effort on this front will be to scale to thousands of users.

Other notable features for DP1 include:

\begin{itemize}
\item IVOA-compatible SIA image service
\item Qserv query temporary uploads
\item User query history capabilities
\item Context-aware documentation
\item Improved  notebook-portal integration
\end{itemize}


There will be no major computational expansion (bulk cutouts, parallel computing, batch processing) is available at this time.There will be quota and API limit handling which along with the roadmap will soon appear on \url{rsp.lsst.io}.

The milestone for RSP readiness (\jira{PREOPS-5439}) is some months before DP1 to allow tutorial testing etc.


\paragraph{Qserv}
Data loading.


\subsection{Rucio}
What do we need for data to be sent to DACs?
